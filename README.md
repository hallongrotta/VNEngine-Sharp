# VNEngine Sharp
A C# port of VNEngine and SceneSaveState (but mostly SceneSaveState). 

SceneConsole window is opened with 'B' by default.

Ported from VNEngine 16.0.

## Pros compared to Python SceneSaveState
* Scene data persists even if UI is closed.
* 100% less Python related bugs.

## Cons
* Larger file sizes
* Less features and flexibility
* 100% more C# related bugs.
