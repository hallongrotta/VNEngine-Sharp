# VNEngine Sharp
A C# port of VNEngine and SceneSaveState. Only SceneSaveState functionality for Koikatsu working currently, can not export to a VN.
The intention of this port is to better integrate SceneSaveState and VNEngine with the current ecosystem of mods for Illusion games that use Bepinex.

SceneConsole window is opened with 'B' by default.

Ported from VNEngine 16.0.
